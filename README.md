You need to download ffmpeg.exe and put it in the same directory.. 


This batch program searches your current directory for image and video files.. so smash your video, gif, image or whatever in the same folder with this batch file and ffmpeg...


was tested using the full version of ffmpeg found here. https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/
